I have created Community Event Management project in 2 module.                                                                                        
In this first module  user can register and login in project.                                                                                         
For running the project= py manage.py runserver =  http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin then django admin pannel will appear.                                  
superusername= event                                                                                                                                 
password=event    
After entered superusername and password, Superuser can view all the registered and login user in django admin pannel.                                                                                                                                      
For registration of new user =  http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/register                                                                                  
For login of new user =  http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/login                                                                                                  
In dashboard we can see who is currently login in project http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/dashboard
